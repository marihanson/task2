## Deep Thought Computer


Deep Thought
The great supercomputer Deep Thought is the most powerful computer ever built, with one exception.

It was designed by hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings, who wanted to know the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everthing.

Its creation annoyed a fair few philosophers, who felt that it was taking over their turf.

After seven and a half million years of serious cogitation, Deep Thought spoke the answer. However, it was so inexplicable that Deep Thought then had to go on and design the most powerful computer ever built (with no exceptions) to work out what the question was.
